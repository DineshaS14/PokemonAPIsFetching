Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

## Summary


Pok√©mon APIs Fetching is an Android application that utilizes the Pok√©mon API to provide users with data about various Pok√©mon. 
Featuring a vibrant theme inspired by the Pok√©mon universe, the app offers several functionalities. 
Users can fetch information about individual Pok√©mon by clicking the "Next" button or searching for specific Pok√©mon using the search bar. 
Additionally, a switch button allows users to toggle between dark and light modes for optimal viewing comfort. 
The app also includes a feature to retrieve data for multiple Pok√©mon at once, presenting them in a RecyclerView within a secondary activity. 
Seamlessly navigating between activities is made possible with a floating button. 
Powered by technologies such as Kotlin, RecyclerView, and Glide, the app offers an engaging experience for Pok√©mon enthusiasts.
If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üòéü•≥ü§©

## Notes

Main Activity (MainActivity):

Initialization of UI elements and listeners.
Handling button clicks to fetch Pokemon data and toggle dark mode.
Utilizing AsyncHttpClient to fetch data from the PokeAPI.
Parsing JSON responses and updating UI accordingly.

Pokemon Adapter (PokemonAdapter):

Implementing RecyclerView.Adapter to manage data binding.
Inflating the layout for each item in the RecyclerView.
Binding Pokemon data to views and setting click listeners.

Second Activity (SecondActivity):

Setting up RecyclerView and adapter for displaying Pokemon data.
recyclerView.addItemDecoration(DividerItemDecoration(this@SecondActivity, LinearLayoutManager.VERTICAL))
  class is used to add visual dividers between items in the RecyclerView. 
  This improves the visual separation and organization of the list items, 
  making it easier for users to distinguish between them.
Fetching Pokemon data from the PokeAPI.
Parsing JSON responses and adding Pokemon objects to the adapter.
Providing a floating action button to navigate back to the MainActivity.
